        <p><strong>Founder: Aarav Singh</strong></p>
        <p>My name is Aarav Singh, and I am currently a sophomore at Stevenson High School.
            I am proud to be the founder of <b>Rejuvenate Ganga</b>, an initiative dedicated 
            to restoring and preserving the sacred Ganga River. With roots in Bihar, 
            where my parents were born—my father hailing from the beautiful town of Munger, 
            known for its unique ecosystem—I have always felt a deep connection to this region. 
            During visits to my family, I witnessed the profound significance of the Ganga, 
            with hundreds of people gathering along its banks each day.</p>
        <p>
            The Ganga is not just a river; 
            it is a lifeline for millions. Its waters nourish vast agricultural lands, provide drinking water, 
            and support countless livelihoods. Communities along its banks rely on the Ganga for fishing, 
            farming, and religious practices. However, increasing pollution threatens their way of life and 
            endangers the delicate ecosystems sustained by the river. 
            This is why I decided to create <b>Rejuvenate Ganga</b> inorder to help River Ganga. 
            We must take action, join me in my journey to help clean Ganga.
