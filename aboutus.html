        <ul class = "Text3">
            <li>The Ganga River commonly known in India as Ganga Maa holds a place of immense reversance in the hearts of millions native to India. Flowing from the peaks of the Himalayas to the lush plains of Northern India and closes off at the majestic Bay of Bengal.</li>
            <br> </br>
            <li>To many tourists the river may be nothing less than a tourist site, but for millions of Indians that inhabit the shores of the Ganges River it is a symbol of life, purity and spirituality, and most of all a sign of Freedom. Throughout history this river has been the home of tribes who used its location to create settlements due to the abundant resources that it contains and the fertile grounds it harbors.</li>
            <br> </br>
            <li>While India has witnessed a history rich of wisdom and prosperity burgeoning around the bank of rivers like Ganga, the modern India has grown into an Industrial force, India’s journey into the industrial age is nothing short of remarkable. India has propelled onto the global stage as a new hub for innovation, creating economic growth, millions of jobs, and securing itself as a leading global economy. 
            </li>
            <br> </br>
            <li>However, this rapid industrial growth, though transformative, has also come with drawbacks–particularly for the environment. One of the profound impacts has been on Ganges River–which flows through 11 of India’s major states–the backbone of Indian culture and spirituality. Factories and cities dump toxic chemicals and sewer water into the once sacred river. The river, which has nourished civilization for thousands of years, now crumbles under the weight of industrial India, threatening not just its own health, but the millions that depend on it.
            </li>
            <br> </br>
            <li>While Indian industrialization has been a driving force behind the nation’s economic growth and global standing, it has also contributed to significant unwanted environmental challenges. We must act now to reverse this damage by supporting initiatives such as bringing awareness among the masses towards self hygiene and cleanliness of river Ganges, and generate funds to achieve the same through your generous support.
            </li>
            <br> </br>
            <li>Through this we can help ensure the Ganges river continues to flow clean and pure for generations to come, not just as a river but a symbol of Indian Freedom. Join us in this crucial
